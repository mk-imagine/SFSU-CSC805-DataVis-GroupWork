%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% TREE
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The visualization will be organized with a home page and four visualization
pages as can be shown in Figure \ref{fig:tree}.  The first page will be our
landing page, with the second page being the overview of the data we will be
presenting.  The second page will show charging infrastructure information,
followed by EV adoption trends, with the final page showing in-depth city
analyses.

    \label{fig:tree}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% HOME
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Our home page shown in Figure \ref{fig:home} will contain a short
description of our data, our visualizations, and direct the user to the
information they are seeking.  Finally, the home page will let the user know the
purpose of our visualization.
\begin{figure}[h]

    \label{fig:home}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% OVERVIEW
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The first actual visualization will be our overview.  This page (Figure \ref{fig:overview}) will give a
broad understanding of the current number of EV's registered, charging stations,
and trends in growth of both.  Likewise, we intend to include correlations
between these statistics in Washington State and other states in the US where
data is available.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The second set of visualizations will provide a much deeper look into charging
infrastructure.  Placeholder text for Figure \ref{fig:charge}
