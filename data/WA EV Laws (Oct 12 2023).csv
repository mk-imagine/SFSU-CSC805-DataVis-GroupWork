5395,WA,Clean Fuel Vehicle Purchasing Requirement,"At least 30% of all new vehicles purchased through a state
contract must be clean fuel vehicles, based on the Washington
Department of Ecology definitions. The percentage of clean fuel
vehicles purchased must increase at the rate of 5% each year.
Dedicated clean fuel vehicles are preferred. In the event that
dedicated clean fuel vehicles are not available or would not meet
operation requirements, conventionally powered vehicles may be
converted to operate on clean fuel or dual-fuel use. (Reference

aims to increase the use of alternative fuels, reduce fleet fuel use,
reduce vehicle emissions, and improve the fuel efficiency of the City of
Seattle\'s (Seattle\'s) fleet. [Download Adobe
Reader](http://get.adobe.com/reader/). Seattle\'s long-term intent is to
continue participating in the Northwest Hybrid Medium and Heavy Duty
Truck Consortium and to continue increasing the use of E85 fuel and
electric vehicles. Seattle met its original goal to have a fleet that is
100% clean and green, through the use of clean fuels and vehicles that
have the highest fuel efficiency and the lowest emissions and meet the
needs of Seattle\'s operations. Seattle also met the specific measures
called for in the plan, including a 5% reduction in the fleet\'s annual
fuel use by 2005 as compared to 1999.

Order](http://www.governor.wa.gov/office/execorders/default.aspx) 14-04,
2014: The Washington Department of Ecology worked with the Washington
Departments of Commerce and Transportation to assess whether
California\'s low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) or other state standards

of 1990 levels by 2020.

The Department of Transportation must work in consultation with the
Departments of Ecology and Commerce and other interest groups to address
low or zero emission vehicles. Additionally, the Office of the Governor
will work with state agencies to seek funding to implement a project for
the electrification of the West Coast interstate highway and associated
metropolitan centers and to purchase electric vehicles and install
public fueling and/or charging infrastructure for electric and other
high-efficiency, zero, or low carbon vehicles. See the [West Coast Green
